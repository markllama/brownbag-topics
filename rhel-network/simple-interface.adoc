= Simple Interfaces in RHEL

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora and their derivative
distributions, network interfaces are initialized from configuration
files in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts`

They can also be managed dynamically by _Network-Manager_.  This
document focuses only on the configuration files and the simplest CLI
network management commands, `ifup`, `ifdown` and `ip`.
Network-Manager will be the topic for another day.
